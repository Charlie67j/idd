# Install Docker for Debian

This is a simple script to install the latest version of docker and docker-compose on a fresh Debian installation.

After creating a sudo user, you can run this script to get docker set up and ready for the first container. 

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Charlie67j/install_docker_debian/master/install_docker_debian.sh && bash install_docker_debian.sh
